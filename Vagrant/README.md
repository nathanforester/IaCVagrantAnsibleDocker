# Local Deployment Example

## Using Vagrant as Local IaC

### Advantages:

- Good learning tool to see how nodes with hypervisors work
- Negates the security risks to your data compared to cloud based computing
- Gives a good insight into using virtual machines and networks

### Disadvatages:

- Deploying an entire project could be unnecessarily complex and time consuming
- For full business effectiveness, migration to cloud is still necessary

The first part of this project has been successfully completed. Vagrant configures two virtual machines using the VirtualBox plugin: one for containerisation and one for configuration. It is now ready for part two: continuous integration and deployment.
